# Reloaded-II-Template-CodeSnippets
These are CodeSnipptes for using for Reloaded-II Mods. For Example: Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden &amp; Persona 5 Royal

If you have Code Snippets you want to share with everyone make a Pull Request or contact me on **Discord: RubyX_Coded#9500**
Please make sure to comment everything you do in your code, so anyone can understand it and if you make Snippets for specific games to name the folder accordingly for example:

"Persona 5 Royal - Process Hooking\"  
-> Config.cs  
-> Mod.cs  
-> (any additional files)
